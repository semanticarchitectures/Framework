    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured around three core user explorations: "Foundations," "Pillars of Trust," and "Challenges & Future." This thematic, non-linear structure was chosen over a direct report-to-page mapping to enhance user engagement and facilitate understanding of complex relationships. The "Pillars of Trust" section, focusing on Safety, Security, and Reliability, serves as the central hub, as these outcomes are the primary user goal. Interactions like clicking on diagram components, filtering content by pillar, and exploring challenge/future roadmaps are designed to allow users to dive into details on demand, preventing information overload and promoting active learning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application uses interactive diagrams and charts to make abstract concepts tangible. Report Info: Core components of semantic architecture. -> Goal: Inform & Organize. -> Viz: Interactive HTML/CSS diagram. -> Interaction: Click a component to see its definition. -> Justification: Visualizes relationships better than a list. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS, Tailwind. | Report Info: Contribution of mechanisms to pillars (Safety, etc.). -> Goal: Compare & Inform. -> Viz: Dynamic Bar Chart. -> Interaction: Chart updates based on selected pillar. -> Justification: Provides a quick visual comparison of mechanism impact. -> Library/Method: Chart.js. | Report Info: Challenges and Future directions. -> Goal: Organize & Inform. -> Viz: Interactive lists and roadmap. -> Interaction: Click to expand details. -> Justification: Presents dense information in a digestible, exploratory format. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS, Tailwind. -->
