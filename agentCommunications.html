    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Calm Neutral" - A palette using warm neutrals (bg-stone-100), a dark, readable text color (text-slate-800), and a gentle teal (teal-500/600) as a subtle accent for focus and interaction. This combination is professional, easy on the eyes, and supports clear information hierarchy. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive, tab-based explorer. A persistent top navigation bar lists the six communication methods, allowing users to non-linearly select and compare them. The main content area dynamically updates to display the selected method's overview, pros, and cons in a structured, side-by-side layout. This structure was chosen over a linear scroll to facilitate direct comparison, which is key to understanding the trade-offs discussed in the source report. The "Conclusion" is always visible at the bottom to provide a constant key takeaway. This user flow encourages exploration rather than passive reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The core content is the pros and cons of six communication methods. Goal: Inform & Compare. Viz/Presentation Method: I used a tabbed interface (buttons) for navigation and a two-column layout (Pros vs. Cons) for the content display. Icons (checkmark/x) are used to visually reinforce the points. This is an HTML/CSS based presentation. Interaction: Clicking a method tab dynamically updates the main content view. This is handled by a vanilla JavaScript function that reads from a data object and populates the DOM. Justification: This approach turns a static list into an engaging comparison tool, making the abstract concepts easier to digest and contrast. It's more effective than a simple document for synthesizing the material. Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for interaction, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <p class="text-teal-100">
                The most effective multi-agent systems rarely rely on a single communication method. The optimal solution is typically a **hybrid approach**, carefully blending different paradigms. For instance, agents might use **Natural Language** for high-level goal setting, **Function/Tool Calling** to execute specific actions, and **Structured Data Exchange** for precise, unambiguous information sharing. The "best" approach is always context-dependent, balancing trade-offs between interpretability, efficiency, robustness, and development complexity.
