The Semantic Architectures Framework is based on three main concepts
1. Agents
2. Organizations
3. Missions

We can view agents as emulations of people.  They can be given training and information, assigned roles and responsibilities, and operate in an organization with other agents and people, with the goal of accomplishing their assigned missions.

Agents are built from foundation models with context and access to tools.  The basic architecture of an agent is best defined in the Model Context Protocol proposed by Anthropic.

Organizations are structured collections of agents and resources that implement a set of capabilities.

Missions present an objective with constraints on how to achieve the objective, assigned resources and authorities, and performance evaluations
